            The project was a part of the course TDT4140 Software Development by Prof. Pekka Kalevi Abrahamsson at NTNU. The topic of year 2017 was students revolutionizing university education by the use of bot technologies. Based on this condition, the command based chat bot CallyBot for Facebook messenger was chosen by development team 57, named Pentum. This chapter introduces the project background and opportunity, the project goals and the stateholders

        <p><a name="toc.1"><h1>1&nbsp;Project background and Opportunity</h1> As of the projects initialization, students had a lot of channels to keep track of and gather information from, and their studies were no exception. It could be difficult to keep track of all the hand-ins and deadlines, both when it came to writing them down and remembering them. Logging in to websites such as itslearning and Blackboard to check a tiny detail could feel overly time-consuming, especially while on mobile. Additionally, students wanted to have their own personal reminder connected to their e-learning platform.

            Due to these reasons the team concluded that a calendar- and reminder-system that made use of already installed and familiar apps would be ideal. The project was planned to be a bot that automatically kept track of private and educational deadlines, and appointments. It would then notify the user through Facebook messenger. Because of the security system already in place through Facebook, the bot would already be communication trough a safe channel, as well as easily accessible. The team planned to develop the system that was easily accessible and user-friendly, and because it used a platform that most students already had possession and knowledge of, no additional installations or introductions needed to be performed.

        <p><a name="toc.2"><h1>2&nbsp;Project Goals</h1>
            The software development project goals for the product CallyBot were to help students with reminders, assignment deadlines, and exam dates. The purpose was to develop a command based chat bot for Facebook messenger, to be used by students at NTNU.

            Assignment deadlines were planned to only be supported for students using itslearning and Blackboard through Feide at NTNU. The only courses available were NTNU courses, which meant that the only exam dates available were from these courses. However, all additional features, such as reminders and build-in commands in Facebook messenger, could also be used by non-NTNU users/students.

            Further details regarding functional requirements and non-functional requirements, in terms of user-stories for the software product, are specified in the product backlog. These requirements can be found in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="#refrequirement specification">(%%requirement specification@@)</a>
            . Additional functions may be developed and implement into CallyBot in the future. This means CallyBot has a wider potential than the defined project scope, and the final software product presented for this course. Future work can be found in Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#reffuture-work">(%%future-work@@)</a>
            . Project constrains may be found in Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#refConstraints">(%%Constraints@@)</a>



        <p><a name="toc.3"><h1>3&nbsp;Stakeholders</h1>
            Based on an executed stakeholder analysis the individuals, groups, and organizations who affect or were affected by the project and the product were identified and assessed. The purpose was to analyse stakeholder expectations and their impact on the project to create a common understanding between the stakeholders about the project.

            It was concluded by the analysis that Facebook and NTNU users were stakeholders as they were users of the bot. The owners of itslearning, Blackboard, IE, and Facebook were stakeholders due to the bot utilizing their systems. And the team and course staff were stakeholders due to their involvement in development of the product, discussed further below.

            In Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#refStakeholdersA">(%%StakeholdersA@@)</a>
            , the identified stakeholders are shown in greater detail.

        <p><a name="toc.3.1"><h2>3.1&nbsp;End users</h2>
            The bot<font face=symbol>¢</font>s target end users, such as the persona shown in Table&nbsp;<a href="#refEndUser">(0)</a>
            , were NTNU students who had trouble with keeping track of their deadlines and students who wished for a simple reminder of upcoming assignments. NTNU students quickly found themselves with many assignments spread over multiple platforms, and thus wished to receive a friendly reminder of them, as to not miss a due date.

            The product was also designed with the possibility that people who use Facebook, but do not study at NTNU, would like to use the additional features featured in the bot. As such it may be used by anyone who wishes to receive reminders on Facebook.



        <p><a name="toc.3.2"><h2>3.2&nbsp;Project team</h2>
            The project team were the stakeholders of most influence and importance, as they were directly involved with all decisions made during the development of the project.

        <p><a name="toc.3.3"><h2>3.3&nbsp;Supervisor</h2>
            The supervisor had direct influence over the project team and the project. Håvard Anda Estensen advised the team frequently during the development phase of the product in terms of biweekly meetings.
